What is Transformer Engine?
==================
.. overview-begin-marker-do-not-remove

Transformer Engine (TE) is a library for accelerating Transformer models on NVIDIA GPUs, including
using 8-bit floating point (FP8) precision on Hopper GPUs, to provide better performance with lower
memory utilization in both training and inference. TE provides a collection of highly optimized
building blocks for popular Transformer architectures and an automatic mixed precision-like API that
can be used seamlessly with your framework-specific code. TE also includes a framework agnostic
C++ API that can be integrated with other deep learning libraries to enable FP8 support for Transformers.

As the number of parameters in Transformer models continues to grow, training and inference for
architectures such as BERT, GPT and T5 become very memory and compute intensive. Most deep learning
frameworks train with FP32 by default. This is not essential, however, to achieve full accuracy for
many deep learning models. Using mixed-precision training, which combines single-precision (FP32)
with lower precision (e.g. FP16) format when training a model, results in significant speedups with
minimal differences in accuracy as compared to FP32 training. With Hopper GPU
architecture FP8 precision was introduced, which offers improved performance over FP16 with no
degradation in accuracy. Although all major deep learning frameworks support FP16, FP8 support is
not available natively in frameworks today.

TE addresses the problem of FP8 support by providing APIs that integrate with popular Large Language
Model (LLM) libraries. It provides a Python API consisting of modules to easily build a Transformer
layer as well as a framework agnostic library in C++ including structs and kernels needed for FP8 support.
Modules provided by TE internally maintain scaling factors and other values needed for FP8 training, greatly
simplifying mixed precision training for users.

Highlights
----------

* Easy-to-use modules for building Transformer layers with FP8 support 
* Optimizations (e.g. fused kernels) for Transformer models 
* Support for FP8 on NVIDIA Hopper (H100) and NVIDIA Ada (RTX 4 GPUs)
* Support for optimizations across all precisions (FP16, BF16) on NVIDIA Ampere GPU architecture generations and later

Installation
----------
.. installation

In the NGC container
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The quickest way to get started with Transformer Engine is the NGC PyTorch container on
`NVIDIA GPU Cloud Catalog <https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/orgs/nvidia/containers/pytorch>`_ (versions 22.09 and later).

.. code-block:: bash

    docker run --gpus all -it --rm nvcr.io/nvidia/pytorch:23.04-py3

Where 23.04 is the container version. For example, 23.04 for April 2023 release.

Pre-requisites
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
* Linux x86_64
* CUDA 11.8 or later
* NVIDIA Driver supporting CUDA 11.8 or later
* cuDNN 8.1 or later
* For fused attention, CUDA 12.1 or later, NVIDIA Driver supporting CUDA 12.1 or later, and cuDNN 8.9 or later.

From source
^^^^^^^^^^^

`See the installation guide <https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/transformer-engine/user-guide/installation.html>`_.

Compiling with Flash Attention 2
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

TransformerEngine release v0.11.0 adds support for Flash Attention 2.0 for improved performance. It is a known issue that Flash Attention 2.0 compilation is
resource intensive and requires a large amount of RAM (see `bug <https://github.com/Dao-AILab/flash-attention/issues/358>`_), which may lead to out of memory
errors during the installation of TransformerEngine. To circumvent the issue, please try setting **MAX_JOBS=1** in the environment. If the errors persist, then
proceed to install a supported version of Flash Attention 1 (v1.0.6 to v1.0.9).

Model Support
----------

While the more granular modules in Transformer Engine allow building any Transformer architecture,
the `TransformerLayer` API of Transformer Engine is flexible enough to build multiple major
Transformer model architectures.

Transformer Engine supports the following DL frameworks: PyTorch, JAX (Flax, Praxis), and TensorFlow.

NOTE: For simplicity, we only show PyTorch examples below. For the usage of `TransformerLayer`
of all supported frameworks, refer to `examples <https://github.com/NVIDIA/TransformerEngine/tree/main/examples>`_.

GPT
^^^

`GPT` architecture has `LayerNorm` at the input side (before `QKV Gemm`) and the residual connection
is taken from the input of that `LayerNorm`. In TE this can be achieved by setting the following
arguments in the `TransformerLayer` API.

.. code-block:: python

  transformer_engine.pytorch.TransformerLayer(
          ...,
          ...,
          apply_residual_connection_post_layernorm=False,
          output_layernorm=False,
          layer_type="encoder",
  )

BERT
^^^^

`BERT` architecture has `LayerNorm` at the output side (after the final `BiasDropoutAdd`) and the
residual connection is taken from the output of that `LayerNorm`. In TE this can be achieved by
setting the following arguments in the `TransformerLayer` API.

.. code-block:: python

  transformer_engine.pytorch.TransformerLayer(
          ...,
          ...,
          apply_residual_connection_post_layernorm=True,
          output_layernorm=True,
          layer_type="encoder",
  )

T5
^^

`T5` architecture has an additional `cross-attention` + `BiasDropoutAdd` + `LayerNorm` block before
the `MLP` layer. In TE this can be added by setting the `layer_type` to `decoder` in the
`TransformerLayer` API.

.. code-block:: python

  transformer_engine.pytorch.TransformerLayer(
          ...,
          ...,
          layer_type="decoder",
  )
