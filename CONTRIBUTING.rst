Contribution Rules

Coding Guidelines
-----------------

* We follow `Google C++ Style Guide <https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html>`_. When no
  rules can be found, follow the already occuring conventions. If there is no precedence in our
  codebase we are open to discussion.
* Prior to your contribution, please make sure that the code passes the linter check. We do both C++
  and Python linting. To invoke the check, please use

  .. code-block:: bash

    TE_PATH=<path to TE source> bash qa/L0_lint/test.sh

* Avoid introducing unnecessary complexity into existing code so that maintainability and
  readability are preserved.
* Try to keep pull requests (PRs) as concise as possible:

  - Avoid committing commented-out code.
  - Wherever possible, each PR should address a single concern. If there are several
    otherwise-unrelated things that should be fixed to reach a desired endpoint, our recommendation
    is to open several PRs and indicate the dependencies in the description. The more complex the
    changes are in a single PR, the more time it will take to review those changes.

* Write PR and commit titles using imperative mood.

  - Format commit messages sticking to rules described in
    `this <https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/>`_ guide.

* Make sure all `L0_*` tests pass:

  - In the :bash:`qa/` directory, there are basic sanity tests scripted in directories named
    `L0_...`. A given test can be executed by running the :bash:`./test.sh` command in each test
    directory. The :bash:`test.sh` script assume that the TE source can be found under
    :bash:`/opt/transformerengine`. This assumption can be changed by setting :bash:`TE_PATH`
    environment variable to the directory containing TE source.
  - One of the tests, `L0_license` tests for valid NVIDIA copyright and license text. If you create
    a new file and do not want to pass copyright rights to NVIDIA, please add the file to the
    `exclude_copyright` list in :bash:`qa/L0_license/config.json`.

* Transformer Engine's default build assumes recent versions of TE's dependencies (CUDA toolkit
  etc.). Contributions that add compatibility with older versions of those dependencies will be
  considered, but NVIDIA cannot guarantee that all possible build configurations work, are not
  broken by future contributions, and retain highest performance.
* Make sure that you can contribute your work to open source (no license and/or patent conflict is
  introduced by your code). You need to `Sign Your Work`_.
* Thanks in advance for your patience as we review your contributions; we do appreciate them!

Sign Your Work
--------------

* We require that all contributors "sign-off" on their commits. This certifies that the contribution
  is your original work, or you have rights to submit it under the same license, or a compatible
  license.

  * Any contribution which contains commits that are not Signed-Off will not be accepted.

* To sign off on a commit you simply use the `--signoff` (or `-s`) option when committing your changes:

  .. code-block:: bash

    $ git commit -s -m "Add cool feature."

  This will append the following to your commit message:

  .. code-block:: text

    Signed-off-by: Your Name <your@email.com>
