    "# Using FP8 and FP4 with Transformer Engine\n",
    "\n",
    "H100 GPU introduced support for a new datatype, FP8 (8-bit floating point), enabling higher throughput of matrix multiplies and convolutions. Blackwell added support for NVFP4 and MXFP8 datatypes. In this example we will introduce these low precision datatypes and show how to use them with Transformer Engine.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction to FP8\n",
    "\n",
    "### Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "The FP8 datatype supported by H100 is actually 2 distinct datatypes, useful in different parts of the training of neural networks:\n",
    "\n",
    "* E4M3 - it consists of 1 sign bit, 4 exponent bits and 3 bits of mantissa. It can store values up to +/-448 and `nan`.\n",
    "* E5M2 - it consists of 1 sign bit, 5 exponent bits and 2 bits of mantissa. It can store values up to +/-57344, +/- `inf` and `nan`. The tradeoff of the increased dynamic range is lower precision of the stored values.\n",
    "\n",
    "<figure align=\"center\" id=\"fig_1\">\n",
    "<img src=\"fp8_formats.png\" width=\"60%\">\n",
    "<figcaption> Figure 1: Structure of the floating point datatypes. All of the values shown (in FP16, BF16, FP8 E4M3 and FP8 E5M2) are the closest representations of value 0.3952.</figcaption>\n",
    "</figure>\n",
    "\n",
    "During training neural networks both of these types may be utilized. Typically forward activations and weights require more precision, so E4M3 datatype is best used during forward pass. In the backward pass, however, gradients flowing through the network typically are less susceptible to the loss of precision, but require higher dynamic range. Therefore they are best stored using E5M2 data format. H100 TensorCores provide support for any combination of these types as the inputs, enabling us to store each tensor using its preferred precision.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mixed precision training - a quick introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to understand how FP8 can be used for training Deep Learning models, it is useful to first remind ourselves how mixed precision works with other datatypes, especially FP16.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mixed precision recipe for FP16 training has 2 components: choosing which operations should be performed in FP16 and dynamic loss scaling.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Choosing the operations to be performed in FP16 precision requires analysis of the numerical behavior of the outputs with respect to inputs of the operation as well as the expected performance benefit. This enables marking operations like matrix multiplies, convolutions and normalization layers as safe, while leaving `norm` or `exp` operations as requiring high precision.\n",
    "* Dynamic loss scaling enables avoiding both over- and underflows of the gradients during training. Those may happen since, while the dynamic range of FP16 is enough to store the distribution of the gradient values, this distribution may be centered around values too high or too low for FP16 to handle. Scaling the loss shifts those distributions (without affecting numerics by using only powers of 2) into the range representable in FP16. \n",
    "\n",
    "<figure align=\"center\">\n",
    "<img src=\"loss_scaling.png\" width=\"50%\">\n",
    "<figcaption> Figure 2: Scaling the loss enables shifting the gradient distribution into the representable range of FP16 datatype. </figcaption>\n",
    "</figure>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mixed precision training with FP8\n",
    "\n",
    "While the dynamic range provided by the FP8 types is sufficient to store any particular activation or gradient, it is not sufficient for all of them at the same time. This makes the single loss scaling factor strategy, which worked for FP16, infeasible for FP8 training and instead requires using distinct scaling factors for each FP8 tensor.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are multiple strategies for choosing a scaling factor that is appropriate for a given FP8 tensor:\n",
    "\n",
    "* just-in-time scaling. This strategy chooses the scaling factor based on the maximum of absolute values (amax) of the tensor being produced. In practice it is infeasible, as it requires multiple passes through data - the operator produces and writes out the output in higher precision, then the maximum absolute value of the output is found and applied to all values in order to obtain the final FP8 output. This results in a lot of overhead, severely diminishing gains from using FP8.\n",
    "* delayed scaling. This strategy chooses the scaling factor based on the maximums of absolute values seen in some number of previous iterations. This enables full performance of FP8 computation, but requires storing the history of maximums as additional parameters of the FP8 operators. \n",
    "\n",
    "<figure align=\"center\">\n",
    "<img src=\"delayed_scaling.png\" width=\"80%\">\n",
    "<figcaption> Figure 3: Delayed scaling strategy. The FP8 operator uses scaling factor obtained using the history of amaxes (maximums of absolute values) seen in some number of previous iterations and produces both the FP8 output and the current amax, which gets stored in the history.</figcaption>\n",
    "</figure>\n",
    "\n",
    "As one can see in Figure 3, delayed scaling strategy requires both storing the history of amaxes, but also choosing a recipe for converting that history into the scaling factor used in the next iteration."

    "\n",
    "### MXFP8 vs FP8\n",
    "\n",
    "The main difference between \"regular\" FP8 and MXFP8 lies in the granularity of the scaling. In FP8, each tensor has a single FP32 scaling factor, so all values in the tensor need to \"fit\" within the dynamic range of the FP8 datatype. This requires using the less precise E5M2 format to represent some tensors in the network (like gradients).\n",
    "\n",

    "</figure>\n",
    "\n",
    "The second difference is the datatype used to store the scaling factors. FP8 uses FP32 (E8M23) while MXFP8 uses an 8-bit representation of a power of 2 (E8M0).\n",

However, while transposing FP8 data is numerically trivial, transposing MXFP8 data requires requantization.\n",

    "## Beyond FP8 - training with NVFP4\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to MXFP8, NVIDIA Blackwell introduced support for an even smaller, 4-bit format called NVFP4. The values are represented there in E2M1 format, able to represent values of magnitude up to +/-6.\n",

    "</figure>\n",
    "\n",
    "### NVFP4 Format\n",
    "\n",
    "NVFP4 format is similar to MXFP8 - it also uses granular scaling to preserve the dynamic range. The differences are:\n",
    "\n",
    " - Granularity of the scaling factors: in NVFP4 format a single scaling factor is used per block of 16 elements, whereas MXFP8 uses 1 scaling factor per block of 32 elements\n",
    " - Datatype of the scaling factors: NVFP4 uses FP8 E4M3 as the scaling factor per block, whereas MXFP8 uses E8M0 as the scaling factor datatype. Choice of E4M3 for the scaling factor enables preservation of more information about mantissa, but does not enable the full dynamic range of FP32. Therefore, NVFP4 uses an additional single per-tensor FP32 scaling factor to avoid overflows.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the NVFP4 training recipe for weight tensors we use a different variant of the NVFP4 quantization, where a single scaling factor is shared by a 2D block of 16x16 elements. This is similar to the weight quantization scheme employed in [DeepSeek-v3 training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19437v1), but with a much finer granularity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### NVFP4 training recipe\n",
    "\n",
    "The NVFP4 training recipe implemented in Transformer Engine is described in [Pretraining Large Language Models with NVFP4](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25149v1) paper. The main elements of the recipe are:\n",
    "\n",
    " - Stochastic Rounding. When quantizing gradients to NVFP4, we use stochastic rounding to avoid the bias introduced by quantization. With stochastic rounding values are rounded probabilistically to one of their two nearest representable numbers, with probabilities inversely\n",
    "proportional to their distances.\n",
    " - 2D Scaling. The non-square size of the quantization blocks, while increasing granularity, has a property that the quantized tensor and its transpose no longer hold the same values. This is important since the transposed tensors are used when calculating gradients of the linear layers. While most tensors are not sensitive to this issue during training, it does affect the training accuracy when applied to the weight tensors. Therefore, the weights of the linear layers are quantized using a 2D scheme, where a single scaling factor is shared by a 2D block of 16x16 elements.\n",
    " - Random Hadamard Transforms. While microscaling reduces the dynamic range needed to represent tensor values, outliers can still have a\n",
    "disproportionate impact on FP4 formats, degrading model accuracy. Random Hadamard transforms address this by reshaping the tensor distribution to be more Gaussian-like, which smooths outliers and makes tensors easier to represent accurately in NVFP4. In Transformer Engine, we use a 16x16 Hadamard matrix for activations and gradients when performing weight gradient computation.\n",
    " - Last few layers in higher precision. The last few layers of the LLM are more sensitive to the quantization and so we recommend running them in higher precision (for example MXFP8). This is not done automatically in Transformer Engine, since TE does not have the full information about the structure of the network being trained. This can be easily achieved though by modifying the model training code to run the last few layers under a different `autocast` (or nesting 2 autocasts in order to override the recipe for a part of the network).\n",
    "\n",
    "The full linear layer utilizing NVFP4 is presented in Figure 9.\n",

    "Sometimes it is desirable to use multiple recipes in the same training run. An example of this is the NVFP4 training, where a few layers at the end of the training should be run in higher precision. This can be achieved by using multiple autocasts, either completely separately or in a nested way (this could be useful when e.g. we want to have a configurable overarching recipe but still hardcode a different recipe for some pieces of the network)."
