    "Transformer Engine (TE) is a library designed primarily for training DL models in low precision. It is not specifically optimized for inference tasks, so other dedicated solutions should be used. NVIDIA provides several [inference tools](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/solutions/ai/inference/) that enhance the entire inference pipeline. Two prominent NVIDIA inference SDKs are [TensorRT](https://github.com/NVIDIA/TensorRT) and [TensorRT-LLM](https://github.com/NVIDIA/TensorRT-LLM).\n",

    "This tutorial illustrates how one can export a PyTorch model to ONNX format and subsequently perform inference with TensorRT. This approach is particularly beneficial if model integrates Transformer Engine layers within more complex architectures. It's important to highlight that for Transformer-based large language models (LLMs), TensorRT-LLM could provide a more optimized inference experience. However, the ONNX-to-TensorRT approach described here may be more suitable for other models, such as diffusion-based architectures or vision transformers.\n",
