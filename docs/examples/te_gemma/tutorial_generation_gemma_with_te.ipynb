    "# Accelerating Generation of the Hugging Face Gemma Model with Transformer Engine\n",
    "\n",
    "Generative AI has made remarkable strides in recent years, with Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT at the forefront. These models have revolutionized how we interact with machine-generated content, providing capabilities that range from writing assistance to complex decision support. The core functionality of these models is the generation process, which involves predicting the next token in a sequence based on the preceding text. This task is critical for applications such as automated content creation, translation, and more, emphasizing the importance of efficient implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "For those seeking a deeper understanding of text generation mechanisms in Transformers, it is recommended to check out the [HuggingFace generation tutorial](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/llm_tutorial).\n",
    "\n",
    "In our previous tutorials on [Llama](../te_llama/tutorial_accelerate_hf_llama_with_te.ipynb) and [Gemma](./tutorial_accelerate_hf_gemma_with_te.ipynb), we demonstrated how finetuning can be accelerated using the Transformer Engine's `TransformerLayer`. Building on this foundation, our current objective is to enhance the generation speed of the Gemma model.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial will introduce and explain several advanced features of the Transformer Engine that contribute to this goal:\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 1. THD Attention Layout.\n",
    "\n",
    "Addressing the challenge of computing attention for sequences with varying lengths, a common method is to pad these sequences and apply an attention mask. The Transformer Engine, however, offers a more optimized approachâ€”by specifying the lengths and offsets of the sequences, attention can be computed directly. Instead of passing the matrix and mask with the shape `[b, s, h, d]`, one can pass a matrix of the shape `[t, h, d]` along with tensors detailing sequence lengths and offsets to run the attention optimized for this case. This specific attention layout is referred to as the **THD layout**.\n",

    "Fig. 3. An attention with thd layer.<br><br>\n",
    "</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 2. CUDA Graphs API.\n",
    "\n",
    "The speed of GPUs is increasing at a rapid pace. It turns out that sometimes the runtime of kernels is shorter than the time it takes for the CPU to submit them, which can lead to significant overhead. CUDA Graphs were developed to address this issue. When certain kernels are executed repeatedly, this tool allows us to record and replay them without CPU involvement. This becomes particularly useful in applications like text generation, where a `TransformerLayer` is run for every token that needs to be generated.\n",
    "\n",
    "We recommend reading further about CUDA Graphs [here](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/cuda-graphs/).\n",
    "\n",
    "PyTorch exposes graphs via a raw `torch.cuda.CUDAGraphclass` and two convenience wrappers, `torch.cuda.graph` and `torch.cuda.make_graphed_callables`. More information about the cuda graphs in Pytorch can be found [here](https://pytorch.org/blog/accelerating-pytorch-with-cuda-graphs/).\n",
    "\n",
    "Transformer Engine supports cuda graphs from version 1.5.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<center>\n",
    "<img src=\"./media/graphs.png\" alt=\"\"><br>\n",
    "Fig. 4. CUDA Graphs speedup.<br><br>\n",
    "</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 3. FP8 Weights Calibration.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assuming that we have a model trained in FP32/BF16 precision and we wish to execute it in FP8 precision, the process isn't straightforward due to the absence of appropriate FP8 scaling factors. In this scenario, FP8 calibration becomes essential. By conducting several forward passes on sample data, we can compute the FP8 saling parameters. This calibration allows the model to operate correctly in FP8 precision.\n",
    "\n",
    "We highly recommend familiarizing yourself with the [tutorial](../../examples/fp8_primer.ipynb) on FP8 precision to understand the importance of proper scaling factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<center>\n",
    "<img src=\"./media/calibration.png\" alt=\"\" ><br>\n",
    "Fig. 5. The weights calibration.<br><br>\n",
    "</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 4. FP8 Model Weights.\n",
    "\n",
    "The typical approach is to store weights in higher precision and then cast them to fp8 before operations. This is critical during training, as it allows us to store some values in high precision to avoid performance drops. However, for inference, this level of precision is not necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "The TransformerEngine includes a feature called `fp8_model_init`, which allows for the creation of models that store only the FP8 copy of the weights. This eliminates the need to cast from higher precision to BF16, saving time on this casting process. Additionally, it helps reduce memory consumption, which can be used to increase the batch size, resulting in even greater speedup.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<center>\n",
    "<img src=\"./media/fp8_model_init.png\" alt=\"\" ><br>\n",
    "Fig. 6. Saving memory with fp8_model_init().<br><br>\n",
    "</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Benchmarking\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll evaluate the generation time across one benchmark: generation with context phase max sequence length = 128, batch size = 64 and number of generated tokens = 1024 - 128.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-info\">\n",
    "<b>Note</b>\n",
    "    \n",
    "This tutorial focuses on showcasing the mentioned features of Transformer Engine in the context of generation. It's important to note, however, that NVIDIA provides another library, [TensorRT](https://developer.nvidia.com/tensorrt), which is optimized for inference tasks and should be considered for such use cases.\n",
