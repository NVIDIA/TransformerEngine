    "# Accelerating Generation of the Hugging Face Gemma Model with Transformer Engine\n",
    "\n",
    "Generative AI has made remarkable strides in recent years, with Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT at the forefront. These models have revolutionized how we interact with machine-generated content, providing capabilities that range from writing assistance to complex decision support. The core functionality of these models is the generation process, which involves predicting the next token in a sequence based on the preceding text. This task is critical for applications such as automated content creation, translation, and more, emphasizing the importance of efficient implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "For those seeking a deeper understanding of text generation mechanisms in Transformers, it is recommended to check out the [HuggingFace generation tutorial](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/llm_tutorial).\n",
    "\n",
    "In our previous tutorials on [Llama](../te_llama/tutorial_accelerate_hf_llama_with_te.ipynb) and [Gemma](./tutorial_accelerate_hf_gemma_with_te.ipynb), we demonstrated how finetuning can be accelerated using the Transformer Engine's `TransformerLayer`. Building on this foundation, our current objective is to enhance the generation speed of the Gemma model.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial will introduce and explain several advanced features of the Transformer Engine that contribute to this goal:\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 1. THD Attention Layout.\n",
    "\n",
    "Addressing the challenge of computing attention for sequences with varying lengths, a common method is to pad these sequences and apply an attention mask. The Transformer Engine, however, offers a more optimized approach—by specifying the lengths and offsets of the sequences, attention can be computed directly. Instead of passing the matrix and mask with the shape `[b, s, h, d]`, one can pass a matrix of the shape `[t, h, d]` along with tensors detailing sequence lengths and offsets to run the attention optimized for this case. This specific attention layout is referred to as the **THD layout**.\n",
    "\n",
    "<center>\n",
    "<img src=\"./media/bshd_attention_1.png\" alt=\"\" width= \"400\"><br>\n",
    "Fig. 1. The sequences and the mask for standard attention layout - padding from the end.<br><br>\n",
    "<img src=\"./media/bshd_attention_2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"400\"><br>\n",
    "Fig. 2. The sequences and the mask for standard attention layout - padding from the beginning.<br><br>\n",
    "<img src=\"./media/thd_attention.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"400\"><br>\n",
    "Fig. 3. An attention with thd layer.<br><br>\n",
    "</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 2. CUDA Graphs API.\n",
    "\n",
    "The speed of GPUs is increasing at a rapid pace. It turns out that sometimes the runtime of kernels is shorter than the time it takes for the CPU to submit them, which can lead to significant overhead. CUDA Graphs were developed to address this issue. When certain kernels are executed repeatedly, this tool allows us to record and replay them without CPU involvement. This becomes particularly useful in applications like text generation, where a `TransformerLayer` is run for every token that needs to be generated.\n",
    "\n",
    "We recommend reading further about CUDA Graphs [here](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/cuda-graphs/).\n",
    "\n",
    "PyTorch exposes graphs via a raw `torch.cuda.CUDAGraphclass` and two convenience wrappers, `torch.cuda.graph` and `torch.cuda.make_graphed_callables`. More information about the cuda graphs in Pytorch can be found [here](https://pytorch.org/blog/accelerating-pytorch-with-cuda-graphs/).\n",
    "\n",
    "Transformer Engine supports cuda graphs from version 1.5.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 3. FP8 Weight Calibration.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assuming that we have a model trained in FP32/BF16 precision and we wish to execute it in FP8 precision, the process isn't straightforward due to the absence of appropriate FP8 scaling factors. In this scenario, FP8 calibration becomes essential. By conducting several forward passes on sample data, we can compute the FP8 saling parameters. This calibration allows the model to operate correctly in FP8 precision.\n",
    "\n",
    "We highly recommend familiarizing yourself with the [tutorial](../../examples/fp8_primer.ipynb) on FP8 precision to understand the importance of proper scaling factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. FP8 Model Weights.\n",
    "\n",
    "The typical approach is to store weights in higher precision and then cast them to fp8 before operations. This is especially useful during training, as it allows us to store some values in high precision to avoid performance drops. However, for inference, this level of precision is not necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "The TransformerEngine offers a feature called `fp8_model_init`, which enables the creation of models that store only the fp8 copy of the weights. This helps reduce memory consumption, which can then be utilized to increase the batch size, leading to a speedup in generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Benchmarking\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll evaluate the generation time across three benchmarks:\n",
    "- Long input sequences (up to 256 tokens) with short generation (up to 128 tokens),\n",
    "- Short input sequences (up to 64 tokens) with long generation (up to 1000 tokens).\n",
    "\n",
    "All benchmarks are conducted with a batch size of 64 using the dataset \"timdettmers/openassistant-guanaco\".\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-info\">\n",
    "<b>Note</b>\n",
    "    \n",
    "This tutorial focuses on showcasing the mentioned features of Transformer Engine in the context of generation. It's important to note, however, that NVIDIA provides another library, [TensorRT](https://developer.nvidia.com/tensorrt), which is optimized for inference tasks and should be considered for such use cases.\n",

It is needed to maintain accucacy during training. However, we can get rid of high precision weights when doing inference. \n",
