    "# Accelerating token generation of the Hugging Face Gemma Model with Transformer Engine\n",
    "\n",
    "Generative AI has made remarkable strides in recent years, with Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT at the forefront. These models have revolutionized how we interact with machine-generated content, providing capabilities that range from writing assistance to complex decision support. The core functionality of these models is the generation process, which involves predicting the next token in a sequence based on the preceding text. This task is critical for applications such as automated content creation, translation, and more, emphasizing the importance of efficient implementation.\n",
    "\n",

    "<figure align=\"center\">\n",
    "<img src=\"./media/generation_animation.gif\" alt=\"\" >\n",
    "<figcaption>\n",
    "Animation 1: Hugging Face Gemma model token generation.\n",
    "</figcaption>\n",
    "</figure>\n",
    "\n",
    "For those seeking a deeper understanding of text generation mechanisms in Transformers, it is recommended to check out the [HuggingFace generation tutorial](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/llm_tutorial).\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous tutorials on [Llama](../te_llama/tutorial_accelerate_hf_llama_finetuning_with_te.ipynb) and [Gemma](./tutorial_accelerate_hf_gemma_finetuning_with_te.ipynb), it was demonstrated how finetuning can be accelerated using the Transformer Engine's `TransformerLayer`. Building on this foundation, the current objective is to enhance the generation speed of the Gemma model.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial will introduce and explain several advanced features of the Transformer Engine that contribute to this goal:\n",
    "\n",
    "###### **1. THD Attention Layout.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Addressing the challenge of computing attention for sequences with varying lengths, a common method is to pad these sequences and apply an attention mask. The Transformer Engine, however, offers a more optimized approach—by specifying the lengths and offsets of the sequences, attention can be computed directly. Instead of passing the tensor with shape `[b, s, h, d]` and the attention mask, one can pass a tensor of the shape `[t, h, d]` along with tensors detailing cumulative sequence lengths and offsets to run the attention optimized for this case. This specific attention layout is referred to as the **THD layout**.\n",
    "\n",
    "<figure align=\"center\">\n",
    "<img src=\"./media/thd_bshd.svg\" alt=\"\">\n",
    "<figcaption>\n",
    "Figure 1: The difference between BSHD (default) and THD attention layouts is as follows: with BSHD, one needs to provide the attention mask, while with THD, one needs to provide cumulative sequence lengths and sequence offsets.\n",
    "</figcaption>\n",
    "</figure>\n",
    "\n",
    "###### **2. CUDA Graphs API.**\n",
    "\n",
    "The speed of GPUs is increasing at a rapid pace. It turns out that sometimes the runtime of kernels is shorter than the time it takes for the CPU to submit them, which can lead to significant overhead. CUDA Graphs can address this issue. When certain kernels are executed repeatedly, it allows us to record and replay them with less CPU involvement. This becomes particularly useful in applications like token generation, where a `TransformerLayer` is run for every token that needs to be generated.\n",
    "\n",
    "One can read more about CUDA Graphs [here](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/cuda-graphs/).\n",
    "\n",
    "PyTorch exposes graphs via a raw `torch.cuda.CUDAGraph` class and two convenience wrappers: `torch.cuda.graph` and `torch.cuda.make_graphed_callables`. More information about the cuda graphs in Pytorch can be found [here](https://pytorch.org/blog/accelerating-pytorch-with-cuda-graphs/).\n",
    "\n",
    "<figure align=\"center\">\n",
    "<img src=\"./media/graphs.svg\" alt=\"\">\n",
    "<figcaption>\n",
    "Figure 2: CUDA Graphs reduce the overhead generated by the long time it takes to launch a single kernel. It enables the recording and replaying of subsequent launches, thus reducing the total time used by the CPU.\n",
    "</figcaption>\n",
    "</figure>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "###### **3. FP8 Weights Calibration.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Assuming that the model is trained in FP32/BF16 precision and the goal is to execute it in FP8 precision, the process isn't straightforward due to the absence of appropriate FP8 scaling factors. In this scenario, FP8 calibration becomes essential. By conducting several forward passes on sample data, the FP8 scaling parameters can be computed. This calibration allows the model to operate correctly in FP8 precision.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is highly recommended to familiarize oneself with the [tutorial](../../examples/fp8_primer.ipynb) on FP8 precision to understand the importance of proper scaling factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<figure align=\"center\">\n",
    "<img src=\"./media/calibration.svg\" alt=\"\">\n",
    "<figcaption>\n",
    "Figure 3:\n",
    "If the model is trained in BF16/FP32, it does not include the computed FP8 scaling factors. When it is run under <b>fp8_autocast()</b>, the value of these scaling factors will default to their initial values, which can cause numerical errors. Weight calibration involves calculating FP8 scaling factors from higher precision forward passes. Once these factors are computed, the model becomes numerically stable. \n",
    "</figcaption>\n",
    "</figure>\n",
    "\n",
    "###### **4. FP8 Model Weights.**\n",
    "\n",
    "The typical approach is to store weights in higher precision and then cast them to fp8 before operations. This may prevent accuraccy drops in training. However, for inference, this level of precision is not necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "The TransformerEngine includes a wrapper `fp8_model_​init`, which allows for the creation of models that store only the FP8 copy of the weights. This eliminates the need to cast from higher precision to BF16, saving time in this casting process. \n",
    "\n",
    "<figure align=\"center\">\n",
    "<img src=\"./media/fp8_model_init.svg\" alt=\"\">\n",
    "<figcaption>\n",
    "Figure 4: Model under <b>fp8_autocast()</b> stores weights in high precision by default, and casts them if needed. It can leads to slowdown and increased memory usage. Using <i>fp8_model_init()</i> results in storing weight in FP8.\n",
    "</figcaption>\n",
    "</figure>\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Benchmarking\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll evaluate the generation time across one benchmark: generation with context phase max sequence length = 128, batch size = 64 and number of generated tokens = 896 on random texts with random lengths.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-info\">\n",
    "<b>Note</b>\n",
    "    \n",
    "This tutorial focuses on showcasing the mentioned features of Transformer Engine in the context of token generation. It's important to note, however, that NVIDIA provides [TensorRT](https://developer.nvidia.com/tensorrt), which is optimized for inference tasks and should be considered for such use cases.\n",
