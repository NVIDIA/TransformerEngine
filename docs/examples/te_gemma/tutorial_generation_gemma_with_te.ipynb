    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Generative AI has made remarkable strides in recent years, with Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT at the forefront. These models have revolutionized how we interact with machine-generated content, providing capabilities that range from writing assistance to complex decision support. The core functionality of these models is the generation process, which involves predicting the next token in a sequence based on the preceding text. This task is critical for applications such as automated content creation, translation, and more, emphasizing the importance of efficient implementation.\n",

    "<figcaption>\n",
    "Animation 1: Hugging Face Gemma model token generation.\n",
    "</figcaption>\n",
    "</figure>\n",
    "\n",
    "For those seeking a deeper understanding of text generation mechanisms in Transformers, it is recommended to check out the [HuggingFace generation tutorial](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/llm_tutorial).\n",
    "\n",
    "In a previous tutorial on [Llama](../te_llama/tutorial_accelerate_hf_llama_finetuning_with_te.ipynb), it was demonstrated how finetuning of an open-source Llama model can be accelerated using Transformer Engine's `TransformerLayer`. Building on that foundation, this tutorial showcases how to accelerate the token generation from the open-source Hugging Face Gemma 7B model.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial introduces several features of the Transformer Engine library that contribute towards this goal. A brief explanation is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. From vanilla KV-caching to Paged Attention for inference in Transformer Engine\n",
    "\n",
    "The original [Attention mechanism](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.03762) ushered in an era of Large Language Models, but the same attention mechanism, if used for deployment in inference scenarios, can be computationally wasteful. It is primarily due to a lot of redundant computation that happens in attention when the Transformer models are used autoregressively to compute the next token. Several tutorials on the internet explain in detail how KV Caching helps to reduce that redundant computation, e.g., [tutorial 1](https://magazine.sebastianraschka.com/p/coding-the-kv-cache-in-llms), [tutorial 2](https://medium.com/@joaolages/kv-caching-explained-276520203249), etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Further, even though the performance benefit of KV Cache is immense, it comes at the cost of increased memory usage, which becomes a problem especially for longer context lengths. The major problems are: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Internal fragmentation\n",
    "2. External Fragmentation\n",
    "\n",
    "More information can be found in the [Paged Attention](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.06180) paper. The authors solve the above problems by treating the KV cache as a virtual memory with the actual physical blocks being much smaller than the overall cache size. This makes it easier to swap them in and out of GPU HBM as needed - very similar to how Operating Systems implement virtual memory to swap the individual pages in and out of the CPU RAM.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Transformer Engine allows users to use both \"Non-paged\" and \"Paged\" forms of KV Caching, and the results in this tutorial are posted for both use cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. CUDA Graphs API\n",
    "\n",
    "The speed of GPUs is increasing at a rapid pace. It turns out that sometimes the runtime of kernels is shorter than the time it takes for the CPU to finish processing and then launch the kernels, which can lead to significant overhead. CUDA Graphs can address this issue. When such blocks of computation are executed repeatedly, CUDA Graphs allow us to record and replay them with less CPU involvement. This becomes particularly useful in applications like token generation, where multiple \"Transformer/Decoder Layers\" are run for every token that needs to be generated.\n",
    "\n",
    "One can read more about CUDA Graphs [here](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/cuda-graphs/).\n",
    "\n",
    "PyTorch exposes graphs via a raw `torch.cuda.CUDAGraph` class and two convenience wrappers: `torch.cuda.graph` and `torch.cuda.make_graphed_callables`. More information about the CUDA graphs in Pytorch can be found [here](https://pytorch.org/blog/accelerating-pytorch-with-cuda-graphs/).\n",
    "\n",
    "<figure align=\"center\">\n",
    "<img src=\"./media/graphs.svg\" style=\"border: 1px solid #000; border-radius: 0;\" alt=\"\" >\n",
    "<figcaption>\n",
    "Figure 1: CUDA Graphs reduce the overhead generated by the long time it takes to launch a single kernel. It enables the recording and replaying of subsequent launches, thus reducing the total time used by the CPU.\n",
    "</figcaption>\n",
    "</figure>\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. FP8 Scaling Factors Calibration\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial uses the `DelayedScaling` recipe for FP8 precision, which relies on the correct calculation of \"scaling factors\".\n",
    "\n",
    "If a model is trained in BF16/FP32, obtaining correct FP8 scaling factors becomes important when it is then run under `fp8_autocast()` context manager. The value of these scaling factors defaults to their initial values, which do not capture the distribution of higher precision weights and input tensors and can cause numerical errors upon usage. Calibration involves capturing an appropriate distribution of higher precision weights and input tensor values and, in turn, calculating appropriate FP8 scaling factors from those. Once these factors are computed, the model becomes numerically stable.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is highly recommended to familiarize oneself with the [tutorial](../../examples/fp8_primer.ipynb) on FP8 precision to understand the importance of proper scaling factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<figure align=\"center\">\n",
    "<img src=\"./media/calibration.svg\" style=\"border: 1px solid #000; border-radius: 0;\" alt=\"\">\n",
    "<figcaption>\n",
    "Figure 2:\n",
    "Assuming that the model is trained in FP32/BF16 precision and the goal is to execute it in FP8 precision, the process isn't straightforward due to the absence of appropriate FP8 scaling factors. In this scenario, FP8 calibration becomes essential. By conducting several forward passes on sample data, the FP8 scaling parameters can be computed. This calibration allows the model to operate correctly in FP8 precision.\n",
    "</figcaption>\n",
    "</figure>\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. FP8 Model Weights\n",
    "\n",
    "The typical approach is to store weights in higher precision and then cast them to FP8 before operations. This may prevent accuracy drops in training. However, for inference, this level of precision is not necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Transformer Engine includes a wrapper `quantized_model_init`, which allows for the creation of models that store only the FP8 copy of the weights. This eliminates the need to cast model weights from higher precision to FP8 every time, thus saving time in the forward pass during token generation. \n",
    "\n",
    "<figure align=\"center\">\n",
    "<img src=\"./media/fp8_model_init.svg\" style=\"border: 1px solid #000; border-radius: 0;\" alt=\"\">\n",
    "<figcaption>\n",
    "Figure 3: Model under <b>fp8_autocast()</b> stores weights in high precision by default, and casts them if needed. If used without consideration, it could potentially not provide the expected speedup and also end up unnecessarily increasing overall GPU memory usage. Using <b>quantized_model_init()</b> results in storing model weights in FP8 by default, which can help with these potential issues.\n",
    "</figcaption>\n",
    "</figure>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Benchmarking\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll evaluate the generation time across one benchmark: token generation with context/prefill phase max sequence length = 20, batch size = 64, and number of generated tokens = 492 on random texts with random lengths. This is a purely synthetic benchmark.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-info\">\n",
    "<b>Note</b>\n",
    "    \n",
    "This tutorial focuses on showcasing the mentioned features of the Transformer Engine in the context of token generation. It's important to note, however, that NVIDIA provides [TensorRT-LLM](https://docs.nvidia.com/tensorrt-llm/index.html), which is optimized for inference tasks and should be considered for such use cases.\n",

As Figure 5 shows, scaling factors are needed for two types of tensors for this tutorial:\n",

    "\n",
    "If the model is run in FP8 precision with incorrect scaling factors, the resulting FP8-cast model weights and FP8-cast inputs (both converted from BF16 precision) will be significantly misaligned, potentially leading to large errors and inaccurate results.\n",
    "\n",
    "To address this issue, \"calibration\" is used. This involves running several forward iterations in BF16 precision within the context `te.fp8_autocast(enabled=False, calibration=True)`. This setup allows the forward pass to operate at higher precision, while simultaneously collecting `amax_history` and other parameters related to the FP8 precision, which are essential for calculating the \"scaling factors\" that are then used to cast higher precision tensors to FP8 precision more accurately. Calibration in the forward passes calculates the scaling factors for weight and input tensors.\n",

This provides two-fold benefits:\n",

    "This tutorial focuses primarily on making the token generation faster with an off-the-shelf model downloaded from Hugging Face using the following features of the Transformer Engine:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Support for KV Caching (both non-paged and paged),\n",
    "2. Integration with CUDA Graphs,\n",
    "3. FP8 scaling factors calibration,\n",
    "4. Keeping model parameters in FP8 precision.\n",

    "It's worth noting that these features in TE are also readily applicable to other use-cases which haven't been extensively talked about in the tutorial: \n",

    "1. Longer context lengths (with paged KV cache) \n",
    "2. Using less memory during generation (by storing weights in FP8 precision using `quantized_model_init`)\n",

    "Readers are encouraged to explore these use cases by playing around with this tutorial, especially with larger models."
