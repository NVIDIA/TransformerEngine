    "In addition to basic layers like `Linear` and `LayerNorm`, Transformer Engine offers larger modules like `MultiheadAttention` (combines \"LayerNorm\" and \"Self Attention\") and `LayerNormMLP` (combines \"LayerNorm\" and \"MLP\") that could replace their counterparts in the `LlamaDecoderLayer` and potentially provide a speedup. Transformer Engine also offers a full `TransformerLayer` (which further combines `MultiheadAttention` and `LayerNormMLP` layers) which could replace `LlamaDecoderLayer` and provide a speedup (with careful mapping of the weights since the name of the weights are different for those two layers). Let's take a closer look at Transformer Engine's `TransformerLayer`. \n",

    "3. `num_attention_heads`: number of attention heads in the transformer layer.\n",
    "4. `bias`: switch to add additive biases to the submodule layers.\n",
    "5. `layernorm_epsilon`: a value added to the denominator of layer normalization for numerical stability. Default is `1e-5`.\n",
    "6. `hidden_dropout`: dropout probability for the dropout op after FC2 layer (fully connected layer no. 2). Default is `0.1`.\n",
    "7. `attention_dropout`: dropout probability for the dropout op during multi-head attention. Default is `0.1`. \n",
    "8. `fuse_qkv_params`:  if set to True, TransformerLayer module exposes a single fused parameter for query-key-value. This enables optimizations such as QKV fusion without concatentations/splits and also enables the argument fuse_wgrad_accumulation.\n",
    "9. `normalization`: type of normalization applied. Default is `LayerNorm`.\n",
    "10. `activation`: type of activation used in the MLP block. Default is `gelu`.\n",
    "11. `attn_input_format`: controls whether the dimensions of the intermediate hidden states is 'batch first' ('bshd') or 'sequence first' ('sbhd'). `s` stands for the sequence length, `b` batch size, `h` the number of heads, `d` head size. Note that these formats are very closely related to the `qkv_format` in the `MultiHeadAttention` and `DotProductAttention` modules.\n",
    "12. `num_gqa_groups`: number of GQA groups in the transformer layer. Grouped Query Attention is described in [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.13245.pdf). This only affects the keys and values, not the querys. GQA-1 is equivalent to Multi-Query Attention ([MQA](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.02150.pdf)), while GQA-H is equivalent to MultiHead Attention, i.e. `num_gqa_groups = num_attention_heads`.\n",

Even with `BF16` precision, `TransformerLayer` provides a speedup over the baseline implementation. With `FP8` precision, the speed up is even more pronounced!"
