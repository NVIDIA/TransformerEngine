    "- **Tiling:** The non-flash algorithm tries to process the query, key, value tensors in one single step, requiring large amounts of global memory and incurring high volumes of reads/writes between global memory and shared memory.

    "- **Recomputation:** The non-flash algorithm stores the softmax matrix (quadratic to sequence length) to global memory for the backward pass, while the flash algorithm only saves the softmax normalization factors (linear to sequence length). This reduces the amount of memory required as well as the bandwidth utilization between global memory and shared memory. Even though there is extra computation incurred in order to recalculate the attention in the backward pass, the bandwidth savings still provide significant improvement in efficiency.\n",
