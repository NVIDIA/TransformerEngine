Jax
=======

Pre-defined Variable of Logical Axes
------------------------------------
Variables are available in `transformer_engine.jax.sharding`.

* BATCH_AXES: The logical axis of batch dimension. It is usually sharded along DP + FSDP on Mesh.
* SEQLEN_AXES: The logical axis of sequence length dimension. It is usually not sharded.
* SEQLEN_TP_AXES: The logical axis of sequence length dimension. It is usually sharded along TP on Mesh.
* HEAD_AXES: The logical axis of head dimension of MHA. It is usually sharded along TP on Mesh.
* HIDDEN_AXES: The logical axis of hidden dimension. It is usually not sharded.
* HIDDEN_TP_AXES: The logical axis of hidden dimension. It is usually sharded along TP on Mesh.
* JOINED_AXES: The logical axis of non-defined dimension. It is usually not sharded.
