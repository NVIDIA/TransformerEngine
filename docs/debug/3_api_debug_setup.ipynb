    "# Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "Precision debug tools for the Transformer Engine use [Nvidia-DL-Framework-Inspect](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-dlfw-inspect) package from NVIDIA. Here, we provide brief information on how to use it with TE.\n",

    "### initialize()\n",
    "\n",
    "Must be called once on every rank in global context to initialize Nvidia-DL-Framework-Inspect.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Parameters**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **config_file** (*str*, default=\"\"): Path to the `config.yaml` file containing features to enable and layer names. If one wants to run without the config file, pass `\"\"`.\n",
    "- **feature_dirs** (*List[str] | str*): List of directories containing features to load and register. One needs to pass `[/path/to/transformerengine/transformer_engine/debug/features]` to use TE features.\n",
    "- **logger** (*Union[BaseLogger, None]*, default=None): Logger for logging tensor statistics. Should adhere to `BaseLogger` from the [Nvidia-DL-Framework-Inspect](0) package.\n",
    "- **log_dir** (*str*, default= \".\"): Directory path to hold `debug_logs` and `debug_statistics_logs`.  \n",
    "- **tb_writer** (*TensorBoardWriter*, default=None): TensorBoard writer for logging.\n",
    "- **default_logging_enabled** (*bool*, default=False): Enabled default logging to the file.\n",

    "\n",
    "Needed only for logging tensor stats. In multi-GPU training, activation and gradient tensors are distributed across multiple nodes. This method lets you specify the group for reduction of stats; see the [reduction group section](./4_distributed.ipynb#Reduction-groups) for more details.\n",
