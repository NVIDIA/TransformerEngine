    "Precision debug tools with [Nvidia-DL-Framework-Inspect](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-dlfw-inspect) for Transformer Engine are currently supported only for PyTorch.\n",

    "Transformer Engine provides a set of precision debug tools which allow you to easily:\n",
    "\n",
    "- log the statistics for each of the tensors in every matrix multiply (GEMM) operation,\n",
    "- run selected GEMMs in higher precision,\n",
    "- run current scaling - with one scaling factor per tensor - for particular GEMMs,\n",
    "- test new precisions and integrate them with FP8 training,\n",
    "- ... and many more, with only a few changes to the code.\n",

    "There are 4 things one needs to do to use Transformer Engine debug features:\n",

    "1. Create a **config.yaml** file to configure the desired features.\n",
    "2. Import, and initialize the [Nvidia-DL-Framework-Inspect](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-dlfw-inspect) tool, which is installed as the dependency of the Transformer Engine.\n",
    "3. One can pass `name=\"...\"` to the init of every TE layer to easier identify layer names. If this is not provided, names will be inferred automatically.\n",
    "4. Invoke `debug_api.step()` at the end of one forward-backward pass.\n",

    "\n",
    "Let's look at a simple example of training a Transformer layer using Transformer Engine with FP8 precision. This example demonstrates how to set up the layer, define an optimizer, and perform a few training iterations using synthetic data.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# train.py\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "We will demonstrate two debug features on the code above:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Disabling FP8 precision for specific GEMM operations, such as the FC1 and FC2 forward propagation GEMM.\n",
    "2. Logging statistics for other GEMM operations, such as gradient statistics for data gradient GEMM within the LayerNormLinear layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Config file\n",
    "\n",
    "We need to prepare the **config.yaml** file, as below\n",
    "\n",
    "```yaml\n",
    "# config.yaml\n",

    "\n",
    "In the modified code above, the following changes were made:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Added an import for `nvdlfw_inspect.api`.\n",
    "2. Initialized the Nvidia-DL-Framework-Inspect by calling `debug_api.initialize()` with appropriate configuration, specifying the path to the config file, feature directories, and log directory.\n",
