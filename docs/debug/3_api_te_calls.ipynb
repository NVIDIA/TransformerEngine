    "# Calls to Nvidia-DL-Framework-Inspect\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look deeper into how Nvidia-DL-Framework-Inspect with Transformer Engine work together. TransformerEngine layers have some hook calls inside each of the GEMMs. User can define feature classes or use feature classes provided with TE. File `config.yaml` describes which hooks need to be used for which layers. Nvidia-DL-Framework-Inspect combines 3 things: TE training, feature classes and `config.yaml` and takes care of inserting hooks in correct places. This process is illustrated in the image below.\n",

For tensors mentioned in `config.yaml`, behaviour of `modify_tensor_enabled()` and `modify_tensor()` calls are substituted with definitions from the feature class. Other calls return default values - in fact they do nothing. </figcaption>\n",

    "### Categories of the API calls\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 3 categories of API calls, each is used for different purposes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- GEMM calls - invoked during every GEMM, is used to process or quantize tensors and collect information about them,\n",
    "- routing calls - invoked at the beginning of forward pass - they indicate whether a feature is going to use `modify_tensor()`, ... etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "If all routing calls for the layer return `False`, then the layer is invoked in an optimized version with Transformer Engine fusions.\n",
    "If any of the routing calls return `True`, layers are run without the fusion. It is necessary, because some tensors cannot be accessed\n",
    "if fusion happens. An important remark is that if no feature is used for the layer, then it should perform as fast as the layer without initializing `debug_api`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### modify_tensor\n",
    "\n",
    "It allows to insert tensor processing. For example, feature `FakeCastFp8` uses it to emulate casting to FP8, but the tensor is returned in higher precision. It can be invoked at most once for each tensor within a given GEMM operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "This call is invoked if `modify_tensor_enabled` returns `True` and feature is enabled for the *tensor_name* and *gemm*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Args:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `config: Dict` - dictionary containing information from `config.yaml` corressponding to the feature, tensor_name and gemm.\n",
    "- `layer_name: str`,\n",
    "- `tensor: torch.Tensor` - tensor in high precision,\n",
    "- `gemm: str` – one of [`fprop`, `dgrad`, `wgrad`],\n",
    "- `tensor_name: str` – one of [`activation`, `weight`, `gradient`, `output`, `wgrad`, `dgrad`],\n",
    "- `default_quantizer : Quantizer` - quantizer which is used to cast the tensor to lower precision if *modify_tensor* is not invoked. For example, feature per tensor scale uses it to obtain FP8 dtype of the tensor. If recipe indicates that tensor is not cast - for example, if running without FP8 autocast, then `default_quantizer=None`,\n",
    "- `iteration: int` - iteration number - equal to the number of the times `debug_api.step()` was called.\n",
    "- `out: Union[torch.Tensor, transformer_engine.pytorch.QuantizerTensor]` - output tensor, used in weight caching mechanism.\n",
    "\n",
    "Should return:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Union[torch.Tensor, transformer_engine.pytorch.QuantizerTensor, None]` - can be `torch.Tensor` or one of the Transformer Engine's `QuantizedTensor` - the rule is that both tensors returned for each GEMM should have the same type. If both are `Float8Tensor`, then GEMM is run in FP8. If both are `torch.Tensor`, GEMM is run in high precision. Please take that into account especially if only one tensor of the GEMM is processed by the `modify_tensor()`. For example, `FakeQuantFp8` disabled FP8 GEMM to ensure that second tensor is also in high precision. If tensor is not the input for any GEMM - namely  `output`, `wgrad` and `dgrad` - the return type would match input type. \n",
    "Should return `None` if `out` is not `None`.\n",

    "### inspect_tensor\n",
