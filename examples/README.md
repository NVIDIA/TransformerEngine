# Examples

We provide a variety of examples for deep learning frameworks including [PyTorch](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch), [JAX](https://github.com/jax-ml/jax), and [PaddlePaddle](https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/Paddle). 
Additionally, we offer [Jupyter notebook tutorials](https://github.com/NVIDIA/TransformerEngine/tree/main/docs/examples) and a selection of [third-party examples](#third-party). Please be aware that these third-party examples might need specific, older versions of dependencies to function properly.
