    This class implements a custom autograd function for the Cross Entropy loss. The input tensor can be in BF16/FP32, the
    loss and gradient calculation happens in FP32 only. The returned loss is always in FP32, the input gradients are upcasted
    to the dataype of the input.

        """
        The forward pass of the Cross Entropy loss. If dist_process_group is passed for distributed loss calculation, the input to each
        distributed rank should be (*,V/world_size). Note that each of the ranks should get equal shards along the V dimension.

        Parameters:
        ctx : The context object.
        _input (tensor): The input tensor of shape (B, SQ, V) or (SQ, B, V) where B is batch size, SQ is sequence length, V is vocab size.
        target (tensor): The target tensor of shape (B,SQ) or (SQ, B) where each value is in [0, V-1].
        label_smoothing (float): The amount of smoothing when computing the loss, where 0.0 means no smoothing.
        reduce_loss (bool): If true, returns the averaged loss across the B*SQ dimension.
        dist_process_group (torch.dist.ProcessGroup): The distributed process group the loss computation is split across, None if on 1 device.

        tensor: The computed loss.
