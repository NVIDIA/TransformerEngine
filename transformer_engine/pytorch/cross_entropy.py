        SQ is sequence length, V is vocab size.
    target : torch.Tensor
        The target tensor of shape ``(B, SQ)`` or ``(SQ, B)`` where each value is in ``[0, V-1]``.
    label_smoothing : float, default = 0.0
        The amount of smoothing when computing the loss, where 0.0 means no smoothing.
    reduce_loss : bool, default = False
        If True, returns the averaged loss across the B*SQ dimension.
    dist_process_group : torch.distributed.ProcessGroup, default = None
        The distributed process group the loss computation is split across, None if on 1 device.
    ignore_idx : int, default = -100
        The index for which loss and gradients are made to zero.
    is_cg_capturable : bool, default = False
        Whether the operation is CUDA graph capturable.

    torch.Tensor
        The computed loss.
