## Not Yet Implemented
- Inplace operations:
    - inplace `nvte.***` for use during inference
    - using those commands in `training` methods of `Op`s
- Torch compile fullgraph support - requires Meta to first fix
- Attention
- Residual
- Type inference
- Model parallelism
- User buffers
- Margin used for scaling factor calculation is currently hardcoded to be 1.0
- Make the sources saved by `exec_saving_source` be garbage collected when there are no references to objects from within the source.
- Cleanup `compute_pipeline_function.py` and `base.py`. Currently they are both a mess full of hacks around Torch Dynamo issues.
- Maybe cleanup `nvte/_common.py`??? It has a complicated implementation of `nvte.torch_op`. Though, maybe it is that's just how this has to be implemented.
- Maybe rename some files and move some code??? Files like `_common.py` or `_storage.py` were supposed to be internal to a folder, but static type chackers complain about them being private. They also export some things...
- ..? Other things supported by current implementation
